<b>• Final Deliverables:</b> They conduct final reviews and quality checks to ensure that all project outputs meet the defined requirements and standards.

<b>• Performance Evaluation:</b> They evaluate project performance, including team performance, budget adherence, and schedule accuracy, to assess overall success and identify areas for improvement.
